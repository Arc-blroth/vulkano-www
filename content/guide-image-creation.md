# Creating an image

In [the buffers creation section of the guide](/guide/buffer-creation) we saw that in order for
the GPU to access data we had to put it in a *buffer*.

This is not exactly true, as there is an alternative which are *images*.

> **Note**: There are only buffers and images, nothing more.

An *image* in the context of Vulkan designates a one-dimensional, two-dimension or
three-dimensional array of values, where each value has a specific format amongst a list of
possible formats.

While we can use Vulkan images to store *images* in the common sense of the word, be aware that
Vulkan images have other usages than just this.

## Different kinds of images

There are four kinds of images:

## Values

## Mipmaps

## Image creation

## Advanced: compressed formats
