            <h3>Safe</h3>

            <p>Vulkano follows the Rust definition of safety. It should be impossible for
                the user to get any undefined behavior using safe code, even when that code seems
                absurd.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Predictable</h3>

            <p>Operations performed by vulkano are precisely documented so that you are able to
                know which underlying Vulkan operation is actually performed, making vulkano very
                easy to profile or debug with Vulkan tools.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Exhaustive</h3>

            <p>If you can use a feature in Vulkan, you can also use it in vulkano (with some
                exceptions, such as experimental extensions).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Convenient</h3>

            <p>Vulkano provides convenient methods on top of Vulkan in order to make it more
                convenient to use.</p>
